// method=track.search - tells the API you want to search songs
// track=${query} - passes the userâ€™s search term
// api_key - includes your personal Last.fm key from .env
// format=json - asks for the data in JSON format


// From MDN: You can use optional chaining when attempting to call a method which may not exist. This can be helpful, for example, when using an API in which a method might be unavailable, either due to the age of the implementation or because of a feature which isn't available on the user's device.



//This function accepts search terms, calls last fm api for tracks, cleans the response and sends back track titles, artists, and cover art to my frontend
